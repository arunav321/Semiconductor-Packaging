# Semiconductor Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration

Welcome to the repository for **Module 1** of the Semiconductor Technology Series. This module focuses on the **evolution of semiconductor packaging**, tracing the journey from basic packaging techniques to cutting-edge 3D integration technologies.

## üì¶ Overview

Semiconductor packaging has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. Initially, its purpose was simply to protect the chip and provide electrical connectivity through leads or pins, using methods such as **Dual In-line Packages (DIP)** and **Quad Flat Packages (QFP)**. However, as integrated circuits (ICs) became more complex and performance demands increased, more advanced packaging solutions like **Ball Grid Arrays (BGA)** and **Chip Scale Packages (CSP)** were developed. These newer techniques allowed for improved thermal management, smaller form factors, and better electrical performance‚Äîpaving the way for system-level integration.

With the rise of data-intensive applications such as **AI, 5G, and high-performance computing**, the limitations of traditional packaging became apparent. This led to the development of **2.5D** and **3D integration technologies**. In 2.5D integration, multiple dies are placed on a shared interposer, enabling high-bandwidth communication between them. 3D integration goes a step further, using **Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)** to stack dies vertically, dramatically shortening interconnect lengths and enabling heterogeneous integration. These innovations represent a paradigm shift in semiconductor design, allowing unprecedented levels of performance, functionality, and efficiency in modern electronic systems.
